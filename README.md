Titanic Data Analysis with Machine Learning
In this project, I explored the Titanic dataset, cleaned the data, built a machine learning model (logistic regression), and made predictions.

Technologies Used:
Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualizations)

Scikit-learn (logistic regression, data splitting)
